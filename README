Patch                                                      status
------------------------------------------------------------------
always accept modules                             acepted in 1.2.5
    modifies treetop to always accept modules in
    the <Foo> construct; without this patch, you
    must be conscious of the structure of the 
    rule and use either a class which descends 
    from SyntaxNode or a module,  as appropriate.
multi-modules                                    proposed for 1.2.5
    Allows a list of modules (or, where a class
    was previously permitted, a class followed 
    by a list of modules) in the <Foo> construct;
    e.g. <Foo,LeftAssociative,DebugTools>

If you have a patch to propose or a comment to make about an existing 
patch, or just follow the discussion about these patches see the treetop
