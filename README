Patch                                                      status
------------------------------------------------------------------
always accept modules                             under discussion
    modifies treetop to always accept modules in
    the <Foo> construct; without this patch, you
    must be conscious of the structure of the 
    rule and use either a class which descends 
    from SyntaxNode or a module,  as appropriate.



If you have a patch to propose or a comment to make about an existing 
patch, or just follow the discussion about these patches see the treetop
development list at http://groups.google.com/group/treetop-dev
